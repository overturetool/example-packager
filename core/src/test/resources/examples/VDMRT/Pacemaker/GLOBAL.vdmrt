\section{Global class}

This is the common parent of the other classes where the shared knowledge 
between all the objects as types definitions is defined.

\begin{vdm_al}
class GLOBAL

types 

\end{vdm_al}

While poling the leads either a pulse is sensed or nothing, that is 
modelled by the union type LeadSense.

\begin{vdm_al}
-- Sensed activity
public
Sense = <NONE> | <PULSE>;
\end{vdm_al}

These senses are associated to the chamber where they were produced and 
again the uninon type is a good representation of it.

\begin{vdm_al}
-- Heart chamber identifier
public 
Chamber = <ATRIA> | <VENTRICLE>;
\end{vdm_al}

Diferently the output the accelerometer provides to the heart-controller
is defined below consitently to the requirement analisys definition that 
is a linear order and thus the choice of a subset of the natural numbers. 

\begin{vdm_al}

-- Accelerometer output
public 
ActivityData = nat1
inv a == a <= 7;

\end{vdm_al}

The heart controller can actuate in two different manners: either do 
nothing or discharge a pulse. The pulse was refined into two categories 
to distinguish if the system outputed an totally artificial pulse or a 
triggered response to sensing.

\begin{vdm_al}
-- Paced actvity
public
Pulse = <PULSE> | <TRI_PULSE>;
\end{vdm_al}

The operation modes are defined as a enumeration of the different
quotes corresponding to each mode.

\begin{vdm_al}
-- Operation mode
public 
Mode = <OFF> | <AOO> | <AAI> | <AOOR> | <AAT> | <DOO> | <DDD>;

\end{vdm_al}

Pulses per minute is an instance of nat1

\begin{vdm_al}
-- PPM
public 
PPM = nat1
inv ppm == ppm >= 30 and ppm <= 175;

\end{vdm_al}

And to promote readabillity Time is defined as nat type synonym. 

\begin{vdm_al}
-- Time
public 
Time = nat;
    
end GLOBAL
\end{vdm_al}
