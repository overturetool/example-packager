As with many modern engineered products, the control software developed at Rolls-
Royce is part of a larger system, namely an engine control system, comprising many
electronic, hydromechanical and electromechanical components. The control system
is part of an engine which, in turn, is a component of an aircraft. This VDM model
is made by Greg Holland as a part of his MSc thesis in this area. It is made 
implicitly so it cannot be executed.
