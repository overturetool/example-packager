This is a VDM-SL Specification of the Dwarf Signal Controller. The VDM
model made in this document is inspired by the Dwarf Signal control
system described by Marcus Montigel, Alcatel Austria AG. The model is
not complete in the sense that it does only model the handing of error
situations for lamp L2. This have been presented at a FM Railway
workshop by Peter Gorm Larsen and it has in the past been connected to
a GUI using the VDMTools CORBA based API. Thus it is a fully
executable specification.
